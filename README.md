Website with GPS Coordinates and Address Conversion
This is a simple website developed by Vincent Otis that allows users to retrieve GPS coordinates, convert them into actual addresses, and validate user-entered addresses. The website consists of three buttons and two text areas.

Features
Button 1: Clicking this button retrieves the GPS coordinates of the device and displays them in the first text area.
Button 2: Clicking this button converts the GPS coordinates displayed in the first text area into an actual address and shows it in the second text area.
Button 3: Allows the user to enter an address in the third text area.
When the user clicks this button, it validates the entered address against the address displayed in the second text area.
If the addresses match, the button turns green.
If the addresses do not match, the button turns red.
How to Use
Open the website in a web browser.
Ensure that your device has location services enabled.
Click Button 1 to retrieve the GPS coordinates of your device. The coordinates will be displayed in the first text area.
Click Button 2 to convert the GPS coordinates into an actual address. The address will be displayed in the second text area.
Enter an address that you think matches the converted address in the third text area.
Click Button 3 to validate the entered address against the converted address.
If the addresses match, the button will turn green.
If the addresses do not match, the button will turn red.
Note: The accuracy of the retrieved GPS coordinates and the converted address may vary depending on the device and the availability of location data.
